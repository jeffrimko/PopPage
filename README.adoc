= PopPage

== Introduction
PopPage is a simple command-line utility originally intended as a static website generator but has since grown into a https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter[cookiecutter] clone. The main features of PopPage are:

  - Uses http://jinja.pocoo.org/[Jinja2 templates] to generate output.
  - Fairly good support for https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter[cookiecutter] templates.
  - Uses YAML to store default key/values for template variables.
  - Output can be single files or directories.
  - Key/values applied to the templates variables can specified on the command line.

A collection of templates is https://github.com/jeffrimko/PopPageTemplates[available here].

== Status
Currently, this project is in the **development release** stage. While this project is suitable for use, please note that there may be incompatibilities in new releases.

Release notes are maintained in the project https://github.com/jeffrimko/PopPage/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[changelog].

== Requirements
PopPage runs on Python 2.7/3.x and uses some third-party libraries.

== Installation
PopPage is https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poppage[available on PyPI here] and can be installed with pip using the following command: `pip install poppage`

== Usage
PopPage can be run from the command line using `poppage`. Type `poppage --help` for usage information. The following subcommands are available:

  - `check` - Check the given INPATH template for variables.
  - `make` - Generates directories and files based on the given INPATH template.
  - `run` - Generates the OUTPATH, executes commands, then deletes OUTPATH.

=== Some Important Notes
Before showing any examples, keep these notes in mind:

  - Template file/directory names can contain template variables (e.g. `{{foo}}.txt`). The provided key/values will be used for the output file generation unless an explicit OUTPATH is provided.
  - The output will be passed to `stdout` if INPATH is a file (rather than a directory) and INPATH does not contain a template variable and no OUTPATH is specified.

=== CLI Key/Values
The following is a quick example of using PopPage from the CLI:

  - Template file (`template.jinja2`):

        Hello {{name}}!

  - PopPage command:

        poppage make --inpath template.jinja2 --string name world

  - Output to `stdout`:

        Hello world!

=== YAML Key/Values
Additionally, default key/values can be stored in a YAML file:

  - Template file (`template.jinja2`):

        Hello {{name}}!

  - Defaults file (`defaults.yaml`):

        name: sun

  - PopPage command:

        poppage make --inpath template.jinja2 --defaults defaults.yaml

  - Output to `stdout`:

        Hello sun!

=== Custom YAML Tags
The following custom YAML tags are provided:

  - `!file` - Reads value from a file as a string.
  - `!yaml` - Reads value from file as YAML.
  - `!opt` - Like `!yaml` but only for populating the `+__opt__+` key.
  - `!cmd` - Reads value from a CLI command output.
  - `!ask` - Prompts the user to input a value.
  - `!py` - Executes Python code.

Check out this example:

  - Template file (`template.jinja2`):

        Hello {{first}} {{last}}!

  - Defaults file (`defaults.yaml`):

        first: !file myfile.txt
        last: !cmd python -c "print('Skywalker')"

  - Content of `myfile.txt`:

        Anakin

  - PopPage command:

        poppage make --inpath template.jinja2 --defaults defaults.yaml

  - Output to `stdout`:

        Hello Anakin Skywalker!

Sometimes it might be helpful to process variables in a defaults file. The `!py` tag can be used in this scenario:

--------
name: !ask &name "Enter a name" <1>
loud: !py ["'{0}'.upper()", *name] <2>
--------
<1> The anchor `&name` is created.
<2> A list must be provided to the `!py` tag. The code is the first element and it can contain standard Python string format variables (e.g. `{0}`) which will be replaced by the following list elements. Note that an anchor reference can be used as an element!

=== Option Defaults
Default utility options can be provided in the defaults file under the `+__opt__+` root key.

Check out these examples:

  - Basic option defaults:

        __opt__:
            inpath: template.jinja2
            outpath: myfile.txt

  - Another options example:

        __opt__:
            inpath: template.jinja2
            outpath: myfile.py
            execute: python myfile.py

  - The execute option can be a template:

        __opt__:
            inpath: template.jinja2
            execute: python {{outpath}}

  - Populate the options using a YAML file:

        __opt__: !opt myopts.yaml

=== Cookiecutter Compatiblity
PopPage should be compatible with many https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter[cookiecutter] templates. Using https://github.com/solarnz/cookiecutter-avr as an example, check for the variables in the template:

    poppage check --inpath https://github.com/solarnz/cookiecutter-avr
    # Found variables:
    #   cookiecutter::full_name
    #   cookiecutter::repo_name
    #   cookiecutter::year

Create a file to store your default values, for example `defaults.yaml`:

    cookiecutter:
        full_name: Henry Jones
        repo_name: LastCrusade
        year: 1989

Run PopPage to generate your files:

    poppage make --inpath https://github.com/solarnz/cookiecutter-avr --defaults defaults.yaml mydest
    # This will generate the entire repo to a new directory named mydest.

    # Or you can do:
    poppage make --inpath https://github.com/solarnz/cookiecutter-avr/tree/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.repo_name%7D%7D --defaults defaults.yaml
    # This will generate the {{cookiecutter.repo_name}} subdirectory to a new directory based on the given variables, in this case LastCrusade.
