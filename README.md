PopPage: a small static website generator
=======
PopPage is written in Python 2.6 using the following third-party libraries:

  - PyYaml
  - Jinja2
  - Docopt

The idea behind PopPage was to create a simple command-line utility that could apply content to Jinja2 templates.

For more information on using PopPage, please refer to the documentation in the main `poppage.py` file.
